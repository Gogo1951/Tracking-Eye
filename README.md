# Tracking Eye

This add-on adds a handy tracking icon to your minimap with a button that lets you easily switch between tracking types.

## Key Features

🚜 Farm Mode: The gatherer's best friend. Automatically cycles between Find Herbs, Find Minerals, and Find Treasure whenever you are mounted or in travel form. Never miss a node again.

💀 Persistent Tracking: Forget to turn tracking back on after a wipe? No problem. Tracking Eye remembers your Persistent Tracking selection and automatically re-applies it the moment you resurrect.

🎯 Free Placement Mode: Want to replace the default tracking icon? Middle-Click to detach the icon and place it anywhere on your screen—perfect for overlaying the default UI in Classic Era.
